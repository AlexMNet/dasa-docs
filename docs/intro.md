# About

Welcome to my journey in the never ending battle to conquer Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). If you are new to software engineering or you have been an engineer for a while but you are in the market for a new job, chances are you are reviewing DSA. In an effort to have all my study material in one easy to access place, I have decided to create this documentation website.

## Data Structures

The first section on the left will only contain Data Structures. Not only basic information about each common data structure but also how to construct them from scratch.

## Algorithms

In the Algorithms section we will put our knowledge of the data structures we have learned to the test. They will be organized by pattern (i.e. Sliding Window, Two Pointers etc.) as seen in resources such as Grokking the coding interview as I feel its best to study one pattern at a time.

### Solutions and Resources

Many of the solutions will be solutions that I have found useful from resources such as:

- [Grokking The Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
- [Neetcode.io](https://www.neetcode.io)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)

And some solutions will be my own or interpretations of common solutions. I will do my best to give credit where credit is do.

All material will be in Javascript. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me at any of my contact links. Thank you!

<!-- ## Getting Started

Welcome to my journey in the never ending battle to conquer Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). If you are new to software engineering or you have been an engineer for a while, chances are you are reviewing DSA.

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
