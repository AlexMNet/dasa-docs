# DASA Docs

DASA standing for <U color="#00bcd4">DA</U>ta <U color="#00bcd4">S</U>tructures & <U color="#00bcd4">A</U>lgorithms is a documenation website created using docusaurus.

The best way for me to learn has always involved teaching. I hope that this will be a great resource for anyone looking to learn not only how to build out Data Structures from scratch (using JavaScript) but also how to use these fascinating strucures to solve common leetcode questions.

I am not currenlty accepting PRs but if you encourter a bug or have a feature request, please feel free to open up an issue.

Thank you!
